[Benno van der Berg](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bennovandenberg/), Principal Software Engineer at [Fiberplane](https://fiberplane.com/), 
sits down with Luca Palmieri.

They discuss Fiberplane's 3-years long journey with Rust, building an interactive observability notebook.  
They touch on Benno's experience switching from .NET to Rust and share insights on using Rust for a commercial product, 
including the reasons behind Fiberplane's Rust adoption. They then dive into the challenges of maintaining Fiberplane's 
codebase and conclude with a few tips for developers looking for Rust jobs.

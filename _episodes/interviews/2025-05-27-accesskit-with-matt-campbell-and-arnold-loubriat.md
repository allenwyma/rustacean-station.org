With [AccessKit](https://accesskit.dev/), [Matt Campbell](https://github.com/mwcampbell) and [Arnold Loubriat](https://github.com/DataTriny) [AccessKit](https://accesskit.dev/) took on the ambitious task of abstracting over
the accessibility APIs of several target OS' to offer toolkit providers one unified way to make their UIs accessible across platforms.

With [AccessKit](https://accesskit.dev/), [Matt Campbell](https://github.com/mwcampbell) and [Arnold Loubriat](https://github.com/DataTriny) took on the ambitious task of abstracting over
the accessibility APIs of several target OS' to offer toolkit providers one unified way to make their UIs accessible across platforms. An interview live at [RustWeek 2025](https://rustweek.org/) with host [Luuk van der Duim](https://github.com/luukvanderduim).
